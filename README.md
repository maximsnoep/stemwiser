# StemWiser for Dutch elections

[Stemwiser.nl](stemwiser.nl) is a web-based tool that helps users explore their political preferences ahead of the Dutch parliamentary elections and municipal elections.

The tool works by presenting users with a series of (anonymous) statements drawn from political parties. After evaluating the statements, users receive aggregated results that show which parties align most closely with their views.

The data is sourced from the [ProDemos](https://stemwijzer.nl/).
